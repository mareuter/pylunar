  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `pylunar` for
local development.

#. Fork the `pylunar` repo on GitHub.
#. Create a vitrual environment for dependency installation.
#. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/pylunar.git

#. Install the dependencies for development and pre-commit hook::

    $ make init

#. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

#. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass style and unit
   tests::

    $ tox

#. Commit your changes (this will cause the pre-commit hook to run) and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

#. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

#. The pull request should include tests.
#. If the pull request adds functionality, put your new functionality into a
   function with a docstring. Run ``scriv create`` to add a changelog fragment and fill out the appropriate section for the change. Add that to the commits for the pull request.
#. The pull request should work for the supported range of Python versions.
   The pull request will run GitHub actions to perform those checks.
   Check https://github.com/mareuter/pylunar/pulls
   for active pull requests and make sure that the checks all passed.


Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

	 $ pytest test/test_pylunar.py
